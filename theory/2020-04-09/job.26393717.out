NIntegrate::slwcon: Numerical integration converging too slowly; suspect one of the following: singularity, value of the integration is 0, highly oscillatory integrand, or WorkingPrecision too small.

                                                                                                                                                               -15               -15
NIntegrate::ncvb: NIntegrate failed to converge to prescribed accuracy after 9 recursive bisections in θ near {θ} = {3.3992}. NIntegrate obtained -3.60476 10    and 1.17585 10    for the integral and error estimates.

NIntegrate::ncvb: NIntegrate failed to converge to prescribed accuracy after 9 recursive bisections in θ near {θ} = {0.0000241858}. NIntegrate obtained -3.46077 10    and 2.95947 10    for the integral and error estimates.

General::stop: Further output of NIntegrate::ncvb will be suppressed during this calculation.

NIntegrate::izero: Integral and error estimates are 0 on all integration subregions. Try increasing the value of the MinRecursion option. If value of integral may be 0, specify a finite value for the AccuracyGoal option.
