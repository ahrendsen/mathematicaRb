The magnet files give the value of the magnetic field in the X, Y, and Z directions respectively. 

The positions for each of these magnetic field values are listed in the positions.csv file.
The first column is the Y position and the second column is the Z position. The X position
for each of these points is 0. 

My intention for this was to generate the shape of the field, then just scale the value of the
maximum point of the magnetic field so that it matches the maximum that I measure on my system. 
As such the unit work is fuzzy, but the coil sizes are 8 in, so my default unit size is in inches
I suppose.
